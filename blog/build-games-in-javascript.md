## Introduction

Hey folks! In the blog we are going to build a platformer game using javascript. We would use Kaplay library to build games.

## Setup

First we need to create a project. We would use kaplay cli tool to create one.

```sh
npx create-kaplay platformer
```

Now, we have created a project with required files. We can start the project using below commands

```sh
cd platformer

npm run dev
```

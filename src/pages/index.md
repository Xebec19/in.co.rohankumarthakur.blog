I am a full stack developer currently working at [Vectoredge](https://vectoredge.io/), where I am involved in developing web applications using technologies such as React, Go, and AWS. Additionally, I actively use Nodejs and PostgreSQL in my personal projects.

When I'm not coding, you can find me indulging in my passion for manga and reading new titles in my free time.

I'm always excited to collaborate on new projects and expand my skill set. Feel free to browse my blogs and get in touch with me if you'd like to work together!

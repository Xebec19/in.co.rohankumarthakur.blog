## Introduction

Creating games has always been a thrilling experience for developers, blending creativity with technical skill. With the rise of HTML5 and JavaScript, building engaging, cross-platform games has become more accessible than ever. In this blog, we'll dive into the world of HTML5 game development, focusing on how to create interactive games using JavaScript and the KaplayJS library. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this guide will equip you with the knowledge to bring your game ideas to life right in the browser. Let's start building!

## Setup

Let's kick off by initializing our project with the following command:

```sh
npx create-kaplay easy-leap
```

Next, navigate into your project directory and start the development server:

```sh
cd easy-leap

npm run dev
```

Once the server is up and running, open your browser to check out the game. You'll see a default layout similar to this:

## Add map

Ok, the tiled map layout doesnt look good. Lets add a skyblue color background here. We can get that background by writing below command in src/main.js

```js
setBackground(141, 183, 255); // set background to skyblue color
```

![src/main.js](/static/img/html5-game/sky-blue-bg.png)

Now, our game would look like below

Lets add a floor to the game. We can add a rectangular floor by below command

```js
k.add([
  rect(width(), 48),
  outline(4),
  area(),
  pos(0, height() - 48),
  body({
    isStatic: true,
  }),
]);
```

![src/main.js](/static/img/html5-game/rect-floor-code.png)

Do notice the body() component, it gives our floor a physical body

## Add player

Now, its time to add a player. First we need to create the sprite for the player. This time, we would create a pixel image of a red ball to be used as player sprite. We would use [piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) to create ball sprite.

```js
k.loadSprite("player",")
```

## Add controls

## Add enemies

## Add levels

## Push games to itch.io
